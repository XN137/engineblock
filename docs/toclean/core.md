Dynamic Test Harness
====================

What is this?

It is a reusable machine pattern (RMP) in software design. This includes core machinery, design documentation, and built-in diagnostic examples. As a machine, it is built upon the followig notions:

1. The core components should be based on tangible concepts.
2. It should be easy to reason about and experiment with.
3. It should be self-standing, but allow for trivial addition of workload plugins.



Naming?

- Dynamic Workload and Instrumentation 
- Testing Instrumentation Runtime Environment


I'd like to contrast this to frameworks and toolkits. As a reusable pattern, it provides a runtime
