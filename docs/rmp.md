Reusable Machine Pattern?
=========================

What is this?

It is a reusable machine pattern (RMP) in software design. This includes core machinery, design documentation, and built-in diagnostic examples. As a machine, it is built upon the following notions:

1. The core components should be based on tangible concepts.
2. It should be easy to reason about and experiment with.
3. It should be self-standing, but allow for trivial addition of workload plugins.

It should provide meaningful architectural trade-offs which are expressed clearly and tangibly.
