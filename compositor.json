Collaborators are welcome. However, there is still work to be done to groom the slope for new users.</p>\n<h2>Documentation Site</h2>\n<p>For docs, please visit the <a href=\"http://docs.engineblock.io/\">EngineBlock Docs Site</a></p>\n<h2>EngineBlock</h2>\n<p>This project aims to provide a missing power tool in the test tooling arsenal.</p>\n<p>The design goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide a useful and intuitive Reusable Machine Pattern for constructing and reasoning about concurrent performance tests. To encourage this, the runtime machinery is based on <a href=\"https://github.com/engineblock/engineblock/blob/master/docs/core_concepts.md\">simple and tangible core concepts</a>.</li>\n<li>Reduce testing time of complex scenarios with many variables. This is achieved by controlling tests from an <a href=\"https://github.com/engineblock/engineblock/blob/master/docs/scripting.md\">open javascript sandbox</a>. This makes more sophisticated scenarios possible when needed.</li>\n<li>Minimize the amount of effort required to get empirical results from a test cycle. For this, <a href=\"https://github.com/engineblock/engineblock/blob/master/docs/metrics.md\">metrics reporting</a> is baked in.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In short, Engine Block wishes to be a programmable power tool for performance\ntesting. However, it is somewhat generic. It doesn&apos;t know directly about a\nparticular type of system, or protocol. It simply provides a suitable machine\nharness in which to put your drivers and testing logic. If you know how to build\na client for a particular kind of system, EB will let you load it like a plugin\nand control it dynamically.</p>\n<p>The most direct way to do this, if you are a tool developer, is to build your\nown activity type drivers and embed EB as the core runtime. You can always\nexperiment with it and learn how it works by using the built-in diagnostic\ndrivers.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The Engine Block project started as a branch of <a href=\"http://github.com/jshook/testclient\">test\nclient</a>. It has since evolved to be more\ngeneric.</p>\n<h2>License</h2>\n<p>EngineBlock is licensed under the Apache Public License 2.0</p>\n"
